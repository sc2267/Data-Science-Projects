# CSProjects
  
  
  This repository contains all of my relevant Computer Science Projects from my first year at Cornell University. Files 
  starting with "a" or "A" are projects I completed in my Java class. The instructions for the assingments are all in the  
  files and I filled in whatever was required of me. 
  
  The other files are all Projects I completed from scratch for my Data Science class. Most of them deal with analyzing 
  factors that affect home pricing. A data set is provided.
